    "content": "Getting Started When reviewing annotations, consider the following:\nThe model starts without any context about classes. Ensure annotations give enough context for each detection class. Too little context (small annotations) leads to poor performance. Too much context (large annotations) makes it hard for the model to distinguish details.\nAnnotation consistency is crucial. Consistent annotations with clear visual features improve detection performance. While some classes may have indistinguishable features, strive for consistency. Use your best judgment to classify objects that may appear different across frames.\nIn general, if something doens’t look right, add a comment! It may warrant a larger conversation on how annotations are done for a specific class.\nAccessing the Annotation Platform Navigate to https://cvat.sandau.dev and login with your provided credentials.\nOnce logged in, the Tasks page will be shown. If you do not see any tasks but would expect to, ensure that you are using the correct “Organization”. To change or view your current organization, select the drop down menu with your username on the top-right of the page. Select “Organization” from the drop down menu and select your organization. If you were provided a direct link to a task or a link to a specific frame (for example: https://cvat.sandau.dev/tasks/3/jobs/3?frame=96), now that you are logged in, change the URL in your web browser and navigate directly to that link and skip step 3.\nSelect the task you wish to review by clicking the task’s corresponding “Open” button. Once selected, the annotation interface will be displayed. Note Your interface may look slightly different. Please see the next step to confirm the interface mode is set correctly.\nEnsure the annotation interface is set to “Review”. Select the drop down menu on the top right of the annotation interface and select “Review”. “Review” mode will now be enabled and the following interface will be shown. Reviewing Annotations Note We highly recommend becoming comfortable with the shortcut keys as they will speed up actions over time.\nNavigating through a video To step through images, use either the highlighted buttons on the top of the interface as shown in the image below or use the F and D keys to step forward or backward respectively. To navigate to the next or previous image which contain annotations, use the Left Arrow and Right Arrow keys.\nAdding a comment to an image Add a comment by either selecting the “Open an issue” button on the left-hand toolbar or by pressing the N key. Once selected, the curser will turn into a pointer-hand. To add a comment to the image, click and drag on the image to create a box indicating the area of interest that the comment refers to. Select “Submit” or press the Enter key to submit the comment.",
